# Daily History - Your Startpage Portal to the Past
## Overview
The **Daily History** is a simple but thoughtful alternative to a browser startpage. It is minimalistic in design to declutter and simplify the everyday startpage experience, while adding a touch of curiosity by sharing interesting historical facts from the current date. It is a fleeting glimpse into the past, fostering deeper appreciation for days gone by.

## Technical Highlights:
1. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes, built on a flexible layout that ensures an optimal viewing experience, easy reading, and navigation with minimal resizing.

2. **Google Search Integration**: Seamless integration of Google's Custom Search Engine which provides users the ability to search the web (perhaps to learn more about a daily historical fact) directly from the startpage.

3. **Dynamic Content**: Uses JavaScript Fetch API to retrieve historical data associated with the current date, providing fresh content daily. Includes a random button to fetch other historical events of the day on demand.

4. **UX Enhancements**: Features a toggle switch between dark and light themes to cater to user preference, and uses localStorage to retain this preference.

## User-Centric Highlights:
1. **Historical Awareness**: Turns an everyday act of opening a browser into something of curiosity, making historical facts accessible and engaging.

2. **Minimalist Aesthetic**: A decluttered interface simplifies the startpage experience.

## Setting It Up:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all required dependencies (e.g., CSS, JavaScript files) are in the respective directories.
3. Open the HTML file in a browser to view.

Or, set Daily History as a startpage by updating the browser's settings.
